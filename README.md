# recolor_min_values_of_diagonals

The project is made to recolor the given matrix's minimal every off-diagonal numbers.

Inputs are: 
            1. N ---> the number of rows(columns)
            2. a,b ---> shows the range of random generated numbers

THe random generated numbers in range [a,b] are stored in the specific file. With special created function we read those numbers and fill up the matrix with them.

Then we find the minimal elements of each off-diagonal and recolor them into red. With coursor-placement-changing functions we are able to make some sort of animation of recoloring.
